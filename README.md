For Touchdesigner. Res controls the number of squares.
/Geo1 use image (button) applies the texture to the geometrys when on. Or uses the uniform picked color of the original vertex uniformly when off.

Yeah, you could do something similarish using instancing. But this is technically alot faster as all calcs are handled on the gpu.

See how I've used it at https://vimeo.com/141266387. I used a count chop attached to an incoming beat trigger to modify the resolution settings.
